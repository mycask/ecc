## Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

**DH** is a mechanism for establishing a common secret between multiple
parties. **DH** can use a _Discrete logarithm problem_(**DLP**) to perform
the Exchange.

We can use:
* Modular arithmetic for **DHE**
* Algebraic structures for **ECDH**

Since, elliptic curve multiplication also involves *discrete log problem*, it
can be used.

### Let's recap Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

Let there be 2 parties, Alice and Bob who want to exchange a key over an
insecure channel.

Alice and Bob generate already have a set of parameters $(G, N)$, where $G$
is the generator and $N$ is a prime number. This is available to everyone.

1. Alice and Bob generate their private integers $a$ and $b$ respectively such
that $1 \leq a, b \leq N-1$.
2. Both calculate $G^a \pmod{N}$ and $G^b \pmod{N}$ which are the public keys
and are exchanged.
3. Now Alice has $G^b \pmod{N}$ and Bob has $G^a \pmod{N}$.
4. Alice and Bob raise the exchanged numbers to their generated integers. i.e.
Alice calculates $(G^b)^a \pmod {N}$ and Bob calculates $(G^a)^b \pmod {N}$
5. They end up with $G^{ab} \pmod {N}$, which serves as the shared entity.

Since, getting $a$ from $G^a \pmod{N}$, given $G, N$ is equivalent to solving
the discrete log problem, it is practically not feasible and thus considered secure.

### Using Elliptic Curves for performing the Key Exchange

Let Alice and Bob be 2 parties who want to exchange a key over an insecure channel.
They already have a set of parameters $(Curve, G, N)$ where $Curve$ is the specific
Elliptic Curve, $G$ is a generator point on the curve, $N$ is the order of the
curve.

1. Alice and Bob generate their private integers $a$ and $b$ respectively such
that $1 \leq a, b \leq N-1$.
2. Both calculate $aG$ and $bG$ which are their public keys and are exchanged.
3. Alice has $b * G$ and Bob has $a * G$.
4. Alice calculates $b * (aG)$ and Bob calculates $a * (aG)$.
5. They end up with the same point on the curve $abG$ and use the $X$ coordinate
as the shared entity.
