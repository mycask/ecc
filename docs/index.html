## Elliptic Curves (Over real numbers)

An **Elliptic Curve** is a plane curve of the form
$$ y^2 = x^3 + ax + b $$

where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. This type if equation is called a
_Weierstrass's elliptic function_ and can be considered a popular choice for elliptic curves.

There is an important property for a curve to be elliptic in nature; It should be non-singular in nature.
This means, the curve should not have cusps, self-intersections or isolated points. To enforce this
condition, the discriminant of the above equation should obey:
$$
\begin{align}
\Delta = & -16 (4a^3 + 27b^3) \\
\Delta \neq & 0 \\
\end{align}
$$

For the case of $\Delta$ less than zero, a non-singular curve has one component or one continuous curve.

### The Group Law

Let's consider all the calculations in [projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane).
This allows us to define a group structure on any smooth cubic curve. Now what does that mean?

#### Group

It is a set with a valid binary operation (between 2 elements of the set) to form a third element
such that four conditions (group axioms) are satisfied. Those 4 axioms are:
* [Closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(mathematics))
* [Associativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associativity)
* [Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element)
* [Invertability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_elements)


#### Projective Plane

Projective plane is simple terms is an extension of the regular Euclidean plane.
One of the specialities of this plane is that it allows parallel line to intersect
at a point in infinity. Quoting from wikipedia, it is equipped with some
some point at infinity to allow this behaviour.

Formal definition for Projective plane:

A **Projective plane** consists of a set of lines, a set of points and a relation
between points and lines called *incidence*, having the following properties.
  * Given any $2$ distinct point, there is exactly one line incident with both of them.
  Only 1 line can be drawn through $2$ unique points
  * Given two distinct lines, there is exactly one point of incident with both of them.
  $2$ lines will only meet a exactly one point. This
  implies that there are no non-meeting lines, i.e. Parallel lines.
  * There are 4 points such that no line is incident with more than $2$ of them.
  [validation required] This should mean that there are atleast one set of points
  that can represent 4 endpoints in the euclidean plane.

In Projective plane, it is more appropriate to say that _A point $P$ is incident with line $L$_
instead of saying _Point $P$ lies on the line $L$_. But to understant and corelate,
you can use it interchangibly.


What we are trying to accomplish here is to model the Elliptic curves as a Group and define binary
operations on that group.

#### Identity Axiom for elliptic curve

Consider a set $S$ with a binary operation $*$ defined on it. If there is an element $e$ in the
set $S$, such that for $a \in S$, $e * a = a * e = a$, then $e$ is called an identity in the set $S$.

For elliptic curves, the Identity element is $[0:1:0]$, as represented in the
[_Homogeneous coordinates_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates).

#### A short note on the Homogeneous Coordinates.

For a point $(x, y)$ on the Euclidean Plane for any non-zero real number $Z$, the triple
$(xZ, yZ, Z)$ is called the set of Homogeneous Coordinates. This means that one point on euclidean plane
can be represented in infinitely Homogeneous Coordinates.

A line through the point $(0, 0)$ can be represented as $nx + my = 0$, with $n$ and $m$ not being zero at the
same time. This can also be represented in parametric form.
$$
\begin{align}
nx &+ my = 0 \\
\frac{x}{m} &= \frac{-y}{n} = \lambda\\
x&=\lambda m, y = -\lambda n
\end{align}
$$

So, now the points can be written as $(\lambda m, \lambda n)$ or in Homogeneous coordinates as $(m, -n, Z)$
where $Z = \frac{1}{\lambda}$.

Now, as $\lambda$ approaches infinity, the euclidean plane point on the line moves further and further and
the Homogeneous coordinate approaches $(m, -n, 0)$. This can also be seen as the point at infinity in the
direction of the line $nx + my = 0$ as the point depends on the slope the line.

Back to identities...

If you see the Identity Element: $[0:1:0]$, it has the 3rd value zero, which means that it is
at infinity and in the general direction of $Y$ axis. Now, why is it taken in that very specific direction?
For that we need to define the Addition operation first.

### Addition on the Curve

If $P$ and $Q$ are 2 different points on the curve, then we uniquely describe a point $R' = P + Q$.
Point $R'$ can be determined by drawing a straight line through $P$ and $Q$.
Suppose it cuts the curve at Point $R$. $R'$ is the reflection of the point in $X$ axis,
which also will lie on the curve as the curve is symmetric about $X$ axis.

Since $R'$ is the reflection of $R$, it can be said that $R'$ = $-R$.

According to the first image, $P, Q, R$ lie on the same line and $P + Q + R = 0$. This can be shown from
the addition relation. $P + Q = R' = -R$, which implies.

If $P = Q$, then we assume the tangent as the line as shown in the second image.

Let's revist the case of _Identity_ at $[0:1:0]$. By definition, $P + O = P$. This can be written as
$P + (-P) + O = 0$. Observe, that the line drawn through $P$ and $-P$ is a vertical line. Now, where would
it meet the curve in that direction, at $[0:1:0]$. it will also meet at $[0:-1:0]$ but that is similar to $O$.
Thus, we have established the Identity element for addition operation.

#### An interesting observation

What if there is a line through 2 points on the curve $P$ and $Q$ which never meets the curve again?
