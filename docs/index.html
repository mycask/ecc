## Elliptic Curves (Over real numbers)

An **Elliptic Curve** is a plane curve of the form
$$ y^2 = x^3 + ax + b $$

where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. This type if equation is called a
_Weierstrass's elliptic function_ and can be considered a popular choice for elliptic curves.

There is an important property for a curve to be elliptic in nature; It should be non-singular in nature.
This means, the curve should not have cusps, self-intersections or isolated points. To enforce this
condition, the discriminant of the above equation should obey:
$$
\begin{align}
\Delta = & -16 (4a^3 + 27b^3) \\
\Delta \neq & 0 \\
\end{align}
$$

For the case of $\Delta$ less than zero, a non-singular curve has one component or one continuous curve.

or
