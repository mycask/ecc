## Scalar Multiplication on Elliptic Curves

As already mentioned, scalar multiplication can be seen as multiple additions.
$$
v * P = Q, v \in \mathbb{Z}
$$

Since, this is easy, it comes down to the implementation. The real strength of
elliptic curves lie in the fact that it is trivially difficult to calculate $v$
if you are given Q and P. This difficulty is due to inverse log
