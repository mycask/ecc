## Scalar Multiplication on Elliptic Curves

As already mentioned, scalar multiplication can be seen as multiple additions.
$$
v * P = Q, v \in \mathbb{Z}
$$

Since, this is easy, it comes down to the implementation. The real strength of
elliptic curves lie in the fact that it is trivially difficult to calculate $v$
if you are given Q and P. The only way is to try all $v$. If $v$ is sufficiently
large it's not feasible to brute force it. This is called _Elliptic curve discrete
logarithm problem_.

Geometrically, for $P + Q = R$, $R$'s position has no relation
to where $P$ and $Q$ are.

### The Trivial way

```python
Q = None
for _ in range(0, v):
  res = add(res, P)
```

If $v$ is too large, this calculation is not feasible.

### Point Doubling

This method uses the polynomial representation of $v$ in base 2, or the binary
notation.

$$
v = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \dots + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}; a_i \in \{0, 1\}
$$

Now, multiply both sides by $P$
$$
vP = a_0P + a_1(xP) + \dots + a_{n-1}(x^{n-1}P)
$$

substituting $x = 2$
$$
vP = a_0P + a_1(2P) + a_2(4P) + \dots + a_{n-1}(2^{n-1}P)
$$

This can be implemented as:
```
Q, d = O, P
while v != 0:
    if v % 2:
      Q = add(Q, d)
    v = v // 2
    d = add(d, d)
return Q
```

### Order of a curve

Let's look at a concept called **Order of a curve**. It denotes the number of
points on the curve. There are various approaches to count the number of points
on the curve.

For example, the bound of order or the cardinality of the curve is given body
$$
| |E(\mathbb{F_q})| - (q + 1)| \leq 2\sqrt{q}
$$

This is called [Hasse's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse%27s_theorem_on_elliptic_curves)

The Naive approach would be to try all points and see if it satifies the function.

### Inversion on multiplication operation

Since, we have a scalar multiplication, it is easy to invert it.
$$
Q = vP
$$

multiply both sides by $v^{-1} \pmod {|E(\mathbb{F_q})|}$ and we can recover the original point.

$$
\begin{align}
P &= v^{-1} Q \\
P &= v^{-1}v P \\
v^{-1}v &= 1 + k |E(\mathbb{F_q})|
\end{align}
$$

Since, there are in total $|E(\mathbb{F_q})|$ elements, the next addition to
the last element should also lie in the same Set of the group, so it has to wrap
around just like addition to the last element in a Field wraps around to $0$.

So, by adding it one more time, it will result in $P$ itself.

$$
\begin{align}
\implies &v^{-1}v P \\
\implies &(1 + k |E(\mathbb{F_q})|) *P \\
\implies &P + k |E(\mathbb{F_q})| *P \\
\implies &P + k O \\
\implies &P
\end{align}
$$

Example:
$$
E = |E(\mathbb{F_q})|
$$

For the curve $P-256$ with the Generator point $G$ and the order $E$
```
E =   ffff ffff 0000 0000 ffff ffff ffff ffff
      bce6 faad a717 9e84 f3b9 cac2 fc63 2551

G = (
      6b17 d1f2 e12c 4247 f8bc e6e5 63a4 40f2
      7703 7d81 2deb 33a0 f4a1 3945 d898 c296,
      4fe3 42e2 fe1a 7f9b 8ee7 eb4a 7c0f 9e16
      2bce 3357 6b31 5ece cbb6 4068 37bf 51f5
    )
E * G = ZERO
E * G + G =
    (
      6b17 d1f2 e12c 4247 f8bc e6e5 63a4 40f2
      7703 7d81 2deb 33a0 f4a1 3945 d898 c296,
      4fe3 42e2 fe1a 7f9b 8ee7 eb4a 7c0f 9e16
      2bce 3357 6b31 5ece cbb6 4068 37bf 51f5
    )

```
Which is why $v$ must be kept private, thus serves as the _Private key_.Since, it's
not so easy to reverse $vP$ to get $v$ given $P$, $vP$ serves as the _Public Key_
