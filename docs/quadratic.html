## Solving Quadratic modular equations

### Basics

### Multiplicative order

For a given integer $a$ in the field $\mathbb{Z/pZ}$, i.e. Prime field $p$, such
that $gcd(a, p) = 1$, the smallest integer $k$ is the Multiplicative order of $a$
iff
$$
a^k \equiv 1 \pmod{p}
$$

### Quadratic Residues and non-residues

An integer $q$ is called a Quadratic Residue in $\mathbb{Z/pZ}$ if there exists
an integer $x$ such that

$$
x^2 \equiv q \pmod{p}
$$

If there exists no solution, then $q$ is a non-residue.

### Legendre Symbol

Legendre symbol is a Multiplicative function with values ${-1, 0, 1}$ that denotes
if a number belongs to quadratic residue or not.

It is defined as:

$$
\left ( \frac{a}{p} \right ) =
\left\{
  \begin{matrix}
    0  &a \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \\
    1  &\text{a is quadratic residue} \\
    -1 &\text{a is quadratic non-residue} \\
  \end{matrix}
\right.
$$

### Translation of Legendre symbol using Fermat's little theorem

The Legendre symbols can be evaluated using Fermat's little theorem.
For $a$ in $\mathbb{Z/pZ}$, what $p$ is and odd prime such that $gcd(a, p) = 1$,
$$
a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \\
(a^{\frac{p-1}{2}} - 1)(a^{\frac{p-1}{2}} + 1) \equiv 0 \pmod{p}
$$

This means either, $a^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ or
$a^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$

if $x^2 \equiv a \pmod{p}$, i.e. some $x$ exists, then
$$
a^{\frac{p - 1}{2}} \equiv (x^2)^{\frac{p - 1}{2}} \equiv x^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}
$$
thus, satisfying the equation.

Since, $a^{\frac{p - 1}{2}} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ is solvable for $a$ and is of
degree $\frac{p - 1}{2}$, there can't me more than $\frac{p - 1}{2}$ roots for
this equation ([Lagrange's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_theorem_(number_theory))).

Which means, all other points are non-residues as we found all the residues.
Since, the equation has to be satified, all other $\frac{p - 1}{2}$ numbers should
now satisfy $a^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$.

**Note**: We are ignoring $0$ in this counting as $0|p$ and thus $\left (\frac{0}{p} \right ) = 0$


Thus, correlating Legendre's symbol and Fermat's little theorem. This is called
[Euler's Criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_criterion).

### Primitive Roots modulo $p$

A number $g$ in $\mathbb{Z/pZ}$ is called a primitive root if every number that is
co-prime to $p$ is congruent modulo a power of $g$.

It can also be explained as Suppose the Set $S = \{n : gcd(n, p) = 1, n \in \mathbb{Z/pZ}\}$,
there exists a $k$ for each element $n$ in the set $S$ such that $g^k \equiv n \pmod{p}$.

A number $g$ is a primitive root then then Multiplicative Order for $g$ is $\varphi\left (n \right )$,
where $\varphi$ is the **Euler Totient Function**.

**Claim**: $\left (\frac{g}{p} \right ) = -1$, where g is a primitive root

**Proof**

Since, $g^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ (for a prime $\varphi\left (n \right ) = p - 1$), and $p-1$
is the multiplicative order, $g^k \not\equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ for $k < p - 1$.

$$
\begin{align}
g^{\frac{p-1}{2}} &\equiv -1 \pmod{p} \\
\left (\frac{g}{p} \right ) &= -1
\end{align}
$$

## Tonelli-Shanks algorithm

The [Tonelli-Shanks algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonelli%E2%80%93Shanks_algorithm)
is used to solve $x^2 \equiv a \pmod{p}$ where $p$ is a prime.

**PS**: References are taken from [MIT OCW - Theory of numbers](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-781-theory-of-numbers-spring-2012/lecture-notes/MIT18_781S12_lec11.pdf)

Let's assume a quadratic non-residue $n$ and let $g$ be the primitive root.
Factor $p - 1 = 2^St$, where $t$ is odd.

Now, set $c \equiv n^t \equiv (g^k)^t \equiv g^{kt}$.

**Claim**: The multiplicative order of $c$ is exactly $2^S$.

**Proof**

$$
\begin{align}
c^{2^S} &\equiv (g^{kt})^{2^S} \\
& \equiv (g^{t2^S})^k \\
& \equiv (g^{p-1})^k \\
& \equiv (1)^k \\
& \equiv 1 \pmod{p}
\end{align}
$$

This means, the multiplicative order of $c$, i.e. $ord(c)$ divides $2^S$, as
if we write $2^S = ord(c)*q$

$$
c^{2^S} \equiv (c^{ord(c)})^q \equiv 1^q \pmod{p}
$$

Also, $ord(c)$ must also be a power of $2$ as it divides $2^S$.

Let's calculate $c^{2^{S-1}}$

$$
\begin{align}
c^{2^{S-1}} & \equiv (g^{kt})^{2^{S-1}} \\
& \equiv (g^{t2^{S - 1}})^k \\
& \equiv (g^{\frac{p - 1}{2}})^k \\
& \equiv (-1)^k
\end{align}
$$

$(10)$ uses $p - 1 = 2^St \implies \frac{p-1}{2} = 2^{S-1}t$

$(11)$ uses the fact that $g$ is a primitive root with order $p-1$ mentioned in
the **Primitive root modulo $n$** section.

Now if $k$ is even, then $n = (g^{k'})^2 \pmod{p}$, then $n$ would become a quadratic
residue, which is against the assumption about $n$, hence $k$ is *odd*.

With $k$ as odd, $c^{2^{S-1}} \equiv (-1)^k \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$, also,
$ord(c)$ must also be a power of $2$.

Let's assume, $c^{2^m} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}; m < S$. If we keep squaring it, we
should, at some point reach at $((\dots(c^{2^m})^2\dots)^2) = c^{2^{S-1}}$.

According to our assumption $c^{2^m} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$, squaring should not
change the congruence and it should still be $1$ when it reaches $c^{2^{S-1}}$.
But we already know that $c^{2^{S-1}} \equiv -1 \pmod{p}$, which means, there
exists no such $m$ and hence $ord(c) = 2^S$.

### The Algorithm
Equation:
$$
r^2 \equiv n \pmod{p}
$$
1. Factor the prime $p - 1 = Q2^S$ where $Q$ is odd.
2. Find a $z$ such that $z$ is a quadratic non-residue in $\mathbb{Z/pZ}$
3. Set $M = S$, $c = z^Q$, $t = n^Q$, $R = n^{\frac{Q + 1}{2}}$
4. Loop
    * if $t == 1$, return R.
    * if $t == 0$, no solution.
    * Find the least $i$ such that $0 < i < M$ and $t^{2^i} \equiv 1$
    * Let $b = c^{2^{M - i - 1}}$ and then set, $M = i$, $c = b^2$, $t = tb$, $R = Rb$.

Let's see how this functions on a high level and what are we trying to achieve here.

Step $1$ should be clear, we are beaking the prime to get into powers of $2$ as
we are trying to reduce $t$ to $1$ while updating $r$ and keeping $n$ same.
For that we are updating the value of $t$ by a factor of $c$ raised to some
power of $2$ so that the algorithm runs quicker. Also, note that we had proved
that $ord(c)$ has to be a power of $2$.

Step $2$, we are using a quadratic non-residue because of the fact that we are
trying to find a $nt$ still a quadratic residue. (**Unclear understanding**)

Step $3$, we set some initial values.

Step $4$, the actual computation starts. Let's try to compute some values and
understand what we are trying to achieve.

The first candidate of making $t \equiv 1$ is $n^Q$, because if that works, we
immediately arrive at the solution as $n^{Q + 1} \equiv n$. We can look at it as
$n^Q$ is the $2^{S-1}$th root of 1.

Let's start reducing $M$ and try to find the pair $(R, t)$ for it. We are trying
to do this because, once $M$ reduces to 0, we get $R^2 \equiv n$, which is what
we are looking for.

Find an $i$ such that $0 < i < M$ and $t^{2^i} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.

Now, let's find the pair $(R', t')$, such that $$(R')^2 \equiv n(t')^2$$

Consider $b \equiv c^{2^{M-i-1}}$, $c' \equiv b^2$ and update $M = i$. Multiply both sides of
the congruence with $b^2$.

$$
(Rb)^2 \equiv n(tb^2) \pmod{p}
$$
Now Observe,
$$
\begin{align}
(c')^{2^{M'-1}} &\equiv (b^2)^{2^{i-1}} \equiv (c^{2^{M-i-1}})^{2^{i-1}} \equiv c^{2^{M-1}} \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \\

(t')^{2^{M' - 1}} &\equiv (tb^2)^{2^{i - 1}} \equiv t^{2^{i - 1}}(c^{2^{M-i}})^{2^{i - 1}} \pmod {p}\\

t^{2^{i - 1}} &\equiv -1 \pmod{p} \\

(c^{2^{M-i}})^{2^{i - 1}} &\equiv c^{2^{M - 1}} \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \\
\end{align}
$$
Eq $(12)$ is -1 because it always results in $M$ which is S and $ord(c) = 2^S$.

Eq $(14)$ is $-1$ because $i$ is the least value, so anything less than it
can't be $1 \pmod{p}$.

So, from $(14)$ and $(15)$, we can convert $(13)$ to
$$
(t')^{2^{M' - 1}} \equiv (-1)(-1) \equiv 1 \pmod {p}
$$
Or, it can also be stated as $ord(t) | 2^{M-1}$.

We see that $M$ is strictly decreasing due to $0 < i < M$, the algorithm will exit
in finite time. If there is no $i$ in the above range, then it's unsolvable.
